0.1.4

- Implemented `willDisplay()` and `didEndDisplaying()` APIs for both `CellViewModel` and `SupplementaryViewModel`. ([@nuomi1](https://github.com/nuomi1), [#121](https://github.com/jessesquires/ReactiveCollectionsKit/pull/121))

0.1.3
-----

- Improve debug descriptions for `CollectionViewModel` and `SectionViewModel` ([@nuomi1](https://github.com/nuomi1), [#119](https://github.com/jessesquires/ReactiveCollectionsKit/pull/119), [#120](https://github.com/jessesquires/ReactiveCollectionsKit/pull/120))

0.1.2
-----

- Fixed bug when chaining multiple calls to `eraseToAnyViewModel()` for both `CellViewModel` and and `SupplementaryViewModel`. Previously, it was possible "double erase" a view model by calling `eraseToAnyViewModel()` multiple times, thus actually losing type information. Now, consecutive calls to `eraseToAnyViewModel()` have no effect. ([@nuomi1](https://github.com/nuomi1), [#117](https://github.com/jessesquires/ReactiveCollectionsKit/pull/117))
